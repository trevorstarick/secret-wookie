DESCRIPTION:  
The game takes place on a planet in an space station, hundreds of years abandoned. The player crash lands on the planet and takes refuge in an abandoned wing of the upper levels of the space station. The first two floors are accessable/played like Terraria in a 2D platformer style to make it easier to access building, upgrading and crafting. All floors below are proceduraly generated dungeons with a space age twist. NPC's design, building design, and colours are all randomly generated. As the player delves deeper into the planet/space station the player can uncover new wings which have new resources, tools and NPCs. Resources and tools can be used to upgrade and rebuild the first two floors or craft new items. NPCs can be hostile, neutral or passive. Hostile NPCs will attack on sight, neutral NPCs can be friendly until provoked. Both will drop experience and/or loot on getting killed. Neutral and passive NPC's can be used to barter for new items, resources or quests. Experience is given for multiple tasks such as exploring, building and fighting. Eperience is used to increase skill levels. Endgame is when the user either dies, upgrades the base enough to live or builds a ship to leave the planet. If the player builds a ship, they have a chance to win (ship surivies and gets back home) or the ship explodes, runs out of fuel or lands on another planet.
